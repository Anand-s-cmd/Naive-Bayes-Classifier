Detailed theoritical explanation of Naive Bayes theorem. And then implemented it from scratch in Python. With the help of the classifier worked on Spam Email Detection. [read here](https://github.com/rekib0023/Naive-Bayes-Classifier/blob/master/Naive%20Bayes.ipynb)

- Probabilistic classifiers
- Bayesian Network Model: ___Naive Bayes model___
- Gaussian Distribution, Log normal Distribution
- Lemmatizing
- The MultinomialNB class of scikit-learn API
